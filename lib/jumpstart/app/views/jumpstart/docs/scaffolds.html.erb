  <p class="mb-4 leading-normal">If you'd like a resource to be shared across a Team, you can scope your controllers to the current team so the resources are shared between users in the associated team.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 leading-normal">Every user has a personal team that's only usable by themselves, so you can easily associate resources to teams and still have private resources to a user.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 leading-normal">Make sure to add <code>team:references</code> when generating your models.</p>
